"x percent of y is equal to y percent of x. so, if you want to find out what 7% of 50 is, you could instead find out what 50% of 7 is, which is 3.5. this means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5.. more examples: if you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. so, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4.

edit: this post got more traction than i was expecting. i'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where i am. i grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. from elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

they've had dramatic changes over the years. in high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). a decade later, i can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. it's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. many middle/high school kids have lan parties. smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). my library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

even though i prefer pin-drop silence, i have no issues with these changes. **it's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. and putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",9

"keep a separate master resume with all previous work experience. when sending out a resume for application, duplicate the file and remove anything that may be irrelevant to the position. you never know when some past experience might become relevant again, and you don't want to forget about it.. edit: wow, this blew way up. and my first time on the front page too. 

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

as far as linkedin go, it's a less-detailed version of the master document i keep, as far as work experience goes, but i go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on linkedin than i do on paper.

"college isn't the only way to start a good career. apprenticeships, trade schools, and military training can be great alternatives in today's world.. the price of four-year universities in the us, among other countries, is huge and growing. there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

if, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**to high school juniors and seniors:** 

your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. if you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. here(https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

these jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. as that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. according to this article(http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. anecdotally, i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**is there any money in it?**

there definitely can be. unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. i'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until _ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt later. 

that's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. you're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**what are my options?**

there are a ton of ways to start a career, but i'll talk about a few.

**apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

a recent report(https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germany's industrial success. the us government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. the federal program is here(https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job center(https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. in a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. one example would be the ibew(http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so i won't bother trying to list a bunch. searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**trade schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. it isn't for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**military** training can also be a great economic ladder. the pay and benefits are good from the start. depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. there are some huge risks associated with this route though, so i would reserve it as a last resort. 

regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. that is not the only income, though. in most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. that's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. on the outside, that would cost a lot.

regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. you could also be a bus driver. you don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. i would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military. there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. the good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. the bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

i know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. in reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**tl;dr**

if you want to get smart, go to college. if you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**edit:** based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. as a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the af lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""no thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

also about the military, i offered it up as a last resort, and i mean that. plenty of commentators are saying ""don't ever think about joining the military for training!"" i don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. if you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

regarding rotc, it is better than nothing. i intentionally didn't mention it though. my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting. if you do rotc, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. after 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. if you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the af, can't say how easy it is in the others. so you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. from a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. additionally, i had a way better time than any officer i know, and i didn't even like the military. the lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. i wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

still relevant to rotc, but about school in general... a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. i'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful lpt. you have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",9
